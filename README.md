# AndroidWebRTC

An Android, pure Java, implementation of WebRTC. No JNI wrapped native code. Supports Android 16+. Uses a forked version
of the LibStreaming library. Still in the very early stages of development. Currently focusing on the Media Capture and Stream
(getUserMedia) part of the standard. Contributions welcomed; pure Java/Android code only, no native code.
